Hi, I’m @Ravi kumar
👀 I’m interested in learning and teaching.
🌱 I’m currently enjoying mentoring through Transflower.
💞️ Sharing is caring.
📫 Doing ordinary things extra ordinarily
My attitude towards any technology is, “I don’t know it all, but I will figure it out”. I find technology fascinating due to its vast ever-changing nature. There is so much to investigate. Every day I come to learn, I find out I know less. This keep my learning spirit alive. Learning and Teaching, my passion keeps me involved in teaching and mentoring Information Technology for more than 25 years. I am loving it.
